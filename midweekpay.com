In addition, seven states have laws that effectively limit maximum loan amounts to less than $500. Although these states also have lower borrowing costs, that is often a result only of the small loan sizes rather than actual lower prices compared with states that permit loans of $500 or higher. Most of these seven states have annual percentage rates (APRs) over 200%, with single-payment loans as the most common payday product.

Lenders generally charge borrowers higher rates on single-payment payday loans than on installment ones even when both are allowed under state law. In Idaho, for instance, lenders charge an average APR of 652% (25% per pay period) for a single-payment $500 payday loan. As a result, borrowing the same $500 repeatedly over four months will cost $1,000 in fees, nearly double the $532 that borrowers pay for a comparable installment loan offered by the same group of lenders.
