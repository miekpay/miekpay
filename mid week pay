To prevent problems caused by unaffordable payday loan products, Pew recommends that the 18 states without payday lending continue to prohibit high-cost loans and that other states either choose to follow those statesâ€™ lead or enact comprehensive reforms like those in Colorado, Hawaii, Ohio, and Virginia. The experiences of those four states provide a clear blueprint for policymakers seeking to protect consumers and enable access to small-dollar credit. And their approaches share four key ingredients: fair prices that are viable for lenders and borrowers, affordable payments, reasonable time to repay, and widespread access to safer credit.


Further, federal agencies should support state reform efforts by preventing single-payment loans nationally, curbing other harmful lending practices, and ensuring that diverse providers, including payday lenders, consumer finance companies, financial technology firms, banks, and credit unions, offer safer, lower-cost installment loans instead of loans with balloon payments.
